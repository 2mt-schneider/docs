## Administrator Email Addresses

We will need the email addresses for the administrators of the **Manage** and **App** tenants in both the Development and Production environments

### Group Email Address

Auth0 will provide a daily uptime report of your PSaaS Appliance service, which is sent to an email address (with a group alias) specified by you.

In the event that there is an issue, you can specify a group alias to receive alerts.

### SMTP Settings

::: note
This information is not required until the required environments are ready. Auth0 will work with you to update your settings. See the [SMTP section](/appliance/infrastructure/security#smtp) of the PSaaS Appliance infrastructure manual.
