## Preferred AWS Regions

You'll be asked for your preferred AWS regions, such as `AWS US-WEST-2`, `AWS US-East-1`, `AWS EU-Central-1`, and so on. You'll need to select:

* One region for your Development node
* One region (with at least three [availability zones](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure)) for your Production cluster
