# Support

Auth0 will provide you with an account to access the [Support Center](${env.DOMAIN_URL_SUPPORT}), where you can obtain information about your Auth0 environment and open support tickets. This account will be linked to your PSaaS Appliance and current [Support](/support) plan.

In general, the tenant name you'll use for support is formatted as follows: **customer_name**-support.

You will also be asked to provide a list of tenant admins, which are the users with the permissions to access the Support Center. Please note that tenant admins can invite additional support users.
